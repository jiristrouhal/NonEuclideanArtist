A simple 3D tool for sketching scenes in a 3D space having non-Euclidean geometry (not only very popular spherical and hyperbolical, but hopefully more generic ones).

The tool will provide initial sketches (including basic lighting) for creating 2D digital art. As such, no fancy effects are required, just to get an idea about
object distance, alignment and shadows. The program should enable to move the camera through the scene.
